## About 

Well the main Idea was to build Application that helps people to find friends for driving together during their trip or driving. All people who wants to have drive together with someone can post DrivePost with exact date and time of departure and arrive and more detailed information about driving rules. The people who wants to join they also can see reviews and driving experience of Drivers and can get Contact Info if they want to join them.
